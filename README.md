## Overview
This project documents an in-depth analysis of Splunk security logs as part of an internship application. It identifies suspicious activity across user accounts and IPs, and proposes a clear incident response strategy — all with a focus on ethical reporting and responsible data handling.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Splunk log ingestion and query execution  
- Pattern recognition for failed logins and unusual behavior  
- Identification of potentially compromised accounts and devices  
- Clear incident response plan with technical and ethical reasoning  
- First-person reflection on cybersecurity, integrity, and impact

## 📁 Files Included
- `incident_response_report.md`: Detailed summary of findings and proposed actions  
- `splunk_queries.txt`: Sample SPL queries used during analysis  
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you’re reading it!)

## 🧠 Personal Takeaway
This task deepened my understanding of real-world security analysis and affirmed my commitment to ethical tech practices. It's a reminder that behind every alert is a system, and behind every system — people.

## 🌱 Next Steps
- Explore automation for log parsing  
- Learn advanced SPL functions  
- Continue integrating empathy into cybersecurity work
